# Astro SQLite HTMX PoC

**Proof-of-concept for a dynamic web application using [Astro.build](https://astro.build/), powered by a [SQLite database](https://sqlite.org/about.html) and progressively enhanced with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).**


## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This web app consists of an index page with a filterable list and a detail page for each item. The items are loaded from a SQLite database file stored within the project.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ northwind.sqlite        <-- database file
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProductList.astro   <-- used in index page & partial
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro        <-- shared between pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
|       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro         <-- filterable list page
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ products.astro      <-- item detail page
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```


## ðŸ§ž Progressive enhancement

This web app works without client-side scripts. The list on the index page can be filtered server-side using the `form` on the page. The index and detail pages are linked with regular `a`nchor tags.

The app is enhanced with HTMX. When enhancement kicks in, the `form` is submitted asynchronously and the list is updated asynchronously. On navigation, the next page is also fetched asynchronously and the HTML is updated without a full page reload.


## ðŸ«™ Database

The database (borrowed from [`jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3`](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3)) structure:

## ðŸ§° Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
